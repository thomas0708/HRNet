# Important notes
The code provided here is to train a network for amplitude reconstruction in digital holographic imaging. It was originally run and tested in Jupyter Notebook. For a generalized utilization to the public, the code is given in Python format and for CPU use. Also, for demonstration purposes, adequate minor revisions are made in the code.

# Dependencies
Modules that the code depends on are given in the first functional block.
